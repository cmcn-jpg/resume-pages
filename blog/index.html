        <p>We all want to make money, make a difference, change the future, and
           I decided that I can do all those things in computer science. I took a webpage design
           course my freshman year of highschool at Northwest PA Collegiate Academy,
           which I found to be useless and I learned next to nothing. For the next two
           years I did little to no coding, spending my time on other things. After
           leaving Collegiate at the end of my sophomore year, I attended Erie High
           School for my junior year during which i had signed up for a class that's
           name was something like CS Principles or video game design or some other generic
           title. The teacher of this course was a man named Jordan Lander, a higher level
           science teacher at the school. I didn't know what to expect of this course but
           I enjoyed my first few days of it. I dont recall quite when it was, but at some point
           towards the beginning of the course I took off and got way ahead. Eventually I wasn't even
           following the curriculum on <a href="https://www.code.org">code.org</a> and Jordan Lander had
           recruited me for a special project in which i created <a href="https://www.projectvibe.org">Project Vibe.</a>
           Project Vibe's goal was to produce a pre-diagnosis of specific mental conditons
           based on survey results. The website has since been shut down due to lack of funds to keep
           it open. Even at this point I wasn't as far as i would have liked.

        <p>Working at my own pace through online tutorials was the key for me and now I'm working on this
         blog to test my knowledge</p>
